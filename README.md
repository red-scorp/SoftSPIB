Software SPI (Bit) class for Arduino with support of not 8-bit aligned transfers.

## Reason

Some HW components use non 8-bit aligned transfers to work properly.
Unfortunately Arduino HW SPI library do not support this kind of data transfer.
Though, we have to enable it.

## Examples
- Loopback is an example of 12-bit data transfer.
